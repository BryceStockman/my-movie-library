# my-movie-library

## Description
This app called 'My Movie Library' contains two sections on the main page. One section labeled 'To Watch' contains, or will contain movies that you would like to watch at some point in the future. The other section labeled 'Watched' is for movies that you have already watch.

These are stored in the database and when the user logs in to their account their movies will be displayed accordingly.

In the menu navigation, the user can select the search link and will be redirected to another page where they can search for whatever movie they would like to add to their library. This search functionality is powered by The Open Movie Database API. When the user enters a movie in the search they will be served 10 options displayed as the movie's poster (if available). If the user is ready to add a movie to their library then they can select the 'ToWatch' or 'Watched' button. Depending on what button the user clicks the movie will be moved to that section on the homepage.

The website is styled with Tailwind CSS along with some custom CSS.

## Considerations for Improvement
The next version of the app we would like to include data about the movie which would be provided by the API and the functionality to leave a star or written rating.
